ancestor retuns the ancestors for every node 

incidence: row is offspring and column are parents 
ancestor: row are anecstors and column are nodes 

```{r, echo=T}
ancestor=function(incidence){
incidence1 <- incidence
incidence2 <- incidence
k <- 1
while (k < nrow(incidence)){
incidence1 <- incidence1%*%incidence
incidence2 <- incidence2 + incidence1
k <-k+1
}
incidence2[which(incidence2[,]>0)] <- 1
return(t(incidence2))}
```

```{r, echo=T}
n=3
incidence=matrix(rep(0, n*n), nrow=3)
incidence[1,2]=1; incidence[2,3]=1
incidence
ancestor(incidence)
```
